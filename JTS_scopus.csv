First an encryption security key is generated using the PRA. Then two images (2D intensities) are combined to form a complex image. The 2D NS-LCT of this complex valued image is then obtained. A nonlinear phase truncation operation is applied to the transformed image and the amplitude is retained and used as the private key. The phase term is multiplied by the security PRA generated key and the inverse 2D NS-LCT is applied to the result giving the output encrypted image. The robustness of the proposed technique is tested against noise, occlusion and chosen-plaintext attacks. Numerical results are presented demonstrating the security of the proposed technique. © 2018",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048324215

The Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm has been a workhorse in this area for many years. The algorithm extracts phase information from intensities captured in two planes related by a Fourier transform. The ability to capture the two intensities in domains other than the image and Fourier plains adds flexibility; various authors have extended the algorithm to extract phase from intensities captured in two planes related by other optical transforms, e.g., by free space propagation or a fractional Fourier transform. These generalizations are relatively simple once a unitary discrete transform is available to propagate back and forth between the two measurement planes. In the absence of such a unitary transform, errors accumulate quickly as the algorithm propagates back and forth between the two planes. Unitary transforms are available for many separable systems, but there has been limited work reported on nonseparable systems other than the gyrator transform. In this letter, we simulate a nonseparable system in a unitary way by choosing an advantageous sampling rate related to the system parameters. We demonstrate a simulation of phase retrieval from intensities in the image domain and a second domain related to the image domain by a nonseparable linear canonical transform.

The technique is based on acquisition of multiple scattered fields for various sample perspectives using digital holographic microscopy. Then, the captured data is processed with one of the tomographic reconstruction algorithms, which enables 3D reconstruction of refractive index distribution. In our recent works we addressed the issue of spatially variant accuracy of the HT reconstructions, which results from the insufficient model of diffraction that is applied in the widely-used tomographic reconstruction algorithms basing on the Rytov approximation. In the present study, we continue investigating the spatially variant properties of the HT imaging, however, we are now focusing on the limited spatial size of holograms as a source of this problem. Using the Wigner distribution representation and the Ewald sphere approach, we show that the limited size of the holograms results in a decreased quality of tomographic imaging in off-center regions of the HT reconstructions. This is because the finite detector extent becomes a limiting aperture that prohibits acquisition of full information about diffracted fields coming from the out-of-focus structures of a sample. The incompleteness of the data results in an effective truncation of the tomographic transfer function for the out-of-center regions of the tomographic image. In this paper, the described effect is quantitatively characterized for three types of the tomographic systems: The configuration with 1) object rotation, 2) scanning of the illumination direction, 3) the hybrid HT solution combing both previous approaches. © 2017 SPIE.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029181361

The laser beam propagating through photo-sensitive polymer PVA/AA can generate a waveguide of higher refractive index in direction of the light propagation. In order to investigate this phenomenon occurring in light-sensitive photopolymer media, the behaviour of a single light beam focused on the front surface of photopolymer bulk is investigated. As part of this work the self-bending of parallel beams separated in spaces during self-writing waveguides are studied. It is shown that there is strong correlation between the intensity of the input beams and their separation distance and the resulting deformation of waveguide trajectory during channels formation. This self-channeling can be modelled numerically using a three-dimension model to describe what takes place inside the volume of a photopolymer media. Corresponding numerical simulations show good agreement with experimental observations, which confirm the validity of the numerical model that was used to simulate these experiments. © 2017 SPIE.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029154715

Digital algorithms to evaluate the 2D-NS-LCTs are important in modeling the light field propagations and also of interest in many digital signal processing applications. In [Zhao 14] we have reported that a given 2D input image with rectangular shape/boundary, in general, results in a parallelogram output sampling grid (generally in an affine coordinates rather than in a Cartesian coordinates) thus limiting the further calculations, e.g. inverse transform. One possible solution is to use the interpolation techniques; however, it reduces the speed and accuracy of the numerical approximations. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, some constraints are derived under which the output samples are located in the Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, no interpolation operation is required and thus the calculation error can be significantly eliminated. © 2017 SPIE.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021796503

Recent attacks by hackers on the databases of large commercial and financial companies have demonstrated that more research and development of advanced approaches are necessary to deny unauthorized access to critical data. Free space optical technology has been investigated by many researchers in information security, encryption, and authentication. The main motivation for using optics and photonics for information security is that optical waveforms possess many complex degrees of freedom such as amplitude, phase, polarization, large bandwidth, nonlinear transformations, quantum properties of photons, and multiplexing that can be combined in many ways to make information encryption more secure and more difficult to attack. This roadmap article presents an overview of the potential, recent advances, and challenges of optical security and encryption using free space optics. The roadmap on optical security is comprised of six categories that together include 16 short sections written by authors who have made relevant contributions in this field. The first category of this roadmap describes novel encryption approaches, including secure optical sensing which summarizes double random phase encryption applications and flaws [Yamaguchi], the digital holographic encryption in free space optical technique which describes encryption using multidimensional digital holography [Nomura], simultaneous encryption of multiple signals [Pérez-Cabré], asymmetric methods based on information truncation [Nishchal], and dynamic encryption of video sequences [Torroba]. Asymmetric and one-way cryptosystems are analyzed by Peng. The second category is on compression for encryption. In their respective contributions, Alfalou and Stern propose similar goals involving compressed data and compressive sensing encryption. The very important area of cryptanalysis is the topic of the third category with two sections: Sheridan reviews phase retrieval algorithms to perform different attacks, whereas Situ discusses nonlinear optical encryption techniques and the development of a rigorous optical information security theory. The fourth category with two contributions reports how encryption could be implemented at the nano- or micro-scale. Naruse discusses the use of nanostructures in security applications and Carnicer proposes encoding information in a tightly focused beam. In the fifth category, encryption based on ghost imaging using single-pixel detectors is also considered. In particular, the authors [Chen, Tajahuerce] emphasize the need for more specialized hardware and image processing algorithms. Finally, in the sixth category, Mosk and Javidi analyze in their corresponding papers how quantum imaging can benefit optical encryption systems. Sources that use few photons make encryption systems much more difficult to attack, providing a secure method for authentication. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84980329381

With an appropriate reconstruction algorithm the intensity values registered by the pixels produce images of a particular (object) scene. These holographic systems are very sensitive to even small vibrations or deformations of an object, mainly due to the phase information that is also recovered by the measurement. Hence these systems are useful in a wide array of different metrology problems. It is important that we somehow quantify the information that can be recovered with such a detection scheme; better if we can provide a theoretical framework to optimize an optical system design for a given metrology problem. In this manuscript we show how the Linear Canonical Transform can fulfill this role and can optimally match the space-bandwidth product (SBP) of a signal to be measured with the SBP of a CCD/CMOS detector array. We provide formulae that determine the performance of generalized holographic optical systems (containing lenses and sections of free space), taking into account the finite extent of the CCD array, the size of the pixels, and the spacing between them.

Since all the forward problems based on realworld physical phenomenon involve some loss of information, the corresponding inverse problem is ill-posed unlike its forward counterpart. This makes the solution of inverse problems quite challenging. A majority of the approaches to solve the phase retrieval problem broadly fall into two categories. In the first category, one uses a priori information of the signal to find one of the many possible approximate solutions to the problem within an acceptable error criteria. One of the first and the most widely used method in this category is the Gerchberg–Saxon (GS) algorithm that uses a priori information of the signal at the input and output plane of an optical system that performs a Fourier Transformation. The second category consists of a direct approach based on a deterministic algorithm. The present chapter is concerned with these approaches. Typically, these algorithms are based on linear transformations on a set of intensity measurements of the signal. These intensity measurements are performed at different planes as the signal propagates through an optical system. In this chapter, we discuss the complex signal determination from multiple intensity measurements. We derive a generic algorithm that can retrieve a complex valued signal from two intensity measurements, one at the input plane and the second at the output plane, of an arbitrary optical system that consists of thin lenses (refractive or GRIN elements) separated by sections of free space. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948844567

The watermark, which is chosen to be in the form of a digital barcode image, is numerically encrypted using a simulation of the optical DRPE process. This produces a random complex image, which is then processed to form a real valued random image with a low number of quantization levels. This signal is added to the host image. Extraction of the barcode, involves applying an inverse DRPE process to the watermarked image followed by low pass filtering. This algorithm is designed to utilize the capability of the DRPE to reversibly spread the energy of the watermarking information in both the space and spatial frequency domains. In this way the energy of the watermark in any spatial or spatial frequency bin is very small. To test robustness several common geometric transformations and signal processing operations are performed using both informed and blind detections for different barcode widths and different quantization levels. The results presented indicate that while the DRPE SS-SS method is robust to scaling, and JPEG compression distortion, it is especially robust to spatial cropping and both low and high pass filtering. Both random-watermark and random-host false positive cases are examined. The uniqueness of the watermark is demonstrated, and it is shown that the DRPE SS-SS has very low false positive errors, and that the larger the barcode width, the lower the false positive rate.

They are capable of providing fast, real-time, reversible or irreversible, visual colorimetric or optical readouts. The main challenge in the development of holographic sensors is to improve their selectivity by functionalizing the holographic recording material and achieve a response to a specific analyte. This material should be permeable to the analyte and its properties should change under exposure to the analyte. This work explores the humidity and temperature response of volume phase gratings recorded in photopolymers containing acrylamide and diacetone acrylamide as monomers, and triethanolamine and N-phenylglycine as photoinitiators. Characterization of the humidity response of photopolymer-based gratings in the relative humidity (RH) range of 20-90 % was carried out by measuring the diffraction efficiency of slanted transmission gratings and the position of the maximum intensity in the spectral response of reflection gratings. A strong humidity dependence of the diffraction efficiency of diacetone acrylamide-based transmission gratings was observed at RH=20-90%. The humidity dependence of the spectral response of the reflection gratings showed that photopolymers containing triethanolamine are more hydrophilic than photopolymers containing N-phenylglycine. The temperature response of slanted transmission gratings was investigated in the temperature (T) range of 20-60 °C. Exposure of the photopolymer layers containing triethanolamine to elevated temperature showed that the observed Bragg angle shift was caused by layer shrinkage due to water evaporation. The application of a sealing technique allowed for the observation of the photopolymer layer swelling due to the layera™s thermal expansion. The results demonstrate an effective approach to obtaining photopolymer-based gratings with tuneable temperature and humidity sensitivity. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

In this paper we extend our analysis to discuss the cases of the 2D non-separable LCT which are used to describe non-orthogonal, non-axially symmetric and anamorphic systems.

This produces a random complex image, which is then processed to form a real valued random image with a low number of quantization levels. This signal is added to the host image. Extraction of the barcode, involves applying an inverse DRPE process to the watermarked image followed by a low pass filter. This algorithm is designed to utilize the capability of the DRPE to reversibly spread the energy of the watermarking information in both the space and spatial frequency domains, and the energy of the watermark in any spatial or spatial frequency bin is very small. The common geometric transformations and signal processing operations are performed using both the informed and the blind detections for different barcode widths and different quantization levels.

The light source was a light-emitting diode (LED; 468. nm) directed at either a single eye or both eyes. All treatments, except the sample collected after 1. h exposure to light, occurred during the dark phase of the 24. h cycle. Serum melatonin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that there was no difference between the level of melatonin inhibition achieved when light was administered to one or two eyes (P= 0.7028). One-way ANOVA of melatonin levels at light intensities of 10, 50 and 100 lux were significantly different to dark (P< 0.05) and not different to light (P> 0.05) intensities. There was no difference between melatonin levels at 3 lux (P> 0.05) and dark intensities. The threshold level of low wavelength light required to inhibit melatonin production in the horse lies between 3 and 10 lux. Melatonin inhibition can be achieved by exposing a single eye to low wavelength blue light. This is a novel finding with important implications for management of artificial lighting regimens in horses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878945983

This technique utilizes the capability of the DRPE to reversibly spread the energy of the input information in both the space and the spatial frequency domains using two diffusers. The watermark is in the form of a digital barcode image which is numerically encrypted using a simulation of the optical DRPE process. This produces a random complex image, which is then processed to form a real valued random image with a low number of quantization levels. This signal is added to the host image. Extraction of the barcode involves applying an inverse DRPE process to the watermarked image followed by a low pass filter. The various noise terms due to the decryption procedure are investigated and we show that these noise terms share the same first-order statistical properties as optical speckle. The results presented indicate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method and it is demonstrated that even when using very few quantization levels, i.e. 2-level, the watermark can still be extracted with very small errors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878303957

For example, the real and imaginary parts of a fully developed speckle field can be modeled as a random circular Gaussian process. When such a speckle field is used to illuminate a second diffuser, the statistics of the resulting doubly scattered field are in general no longer Gaussian, but rather follow a K distribution. In this paper we determine the space-time correlation function of such a doubly scattered speckle field that has been imaged by a single lens system. A space-time correlation function is derived that contains four separate terms; similar to the Gaussian case it contains an average DC term and a fluctuating AC term. However, in addition there are two terms that are related to contributions from each of the diffusers independently. We examine how our space-time correlation function varies as the diffusers are rotated at different speeds and as the point spread function of the imaging system is changed.

In this article, we overcome the complexicy of estimating the rate constant of intersystem crossing, k st, in going from the excited singlet state dye to the excited triplet state dye, by introducing k aS and k aT into the model, which are the rate constant of photon absorption from ground state to singlet state and triplet state respectively. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863594565

In particular, the speckle orientation and the lateral dependence (x and y) of the longitudinal speckle size can vary significantly. For example, the off-axis longitudinal correlation length remains equal to the onaxis size for speckles in a Fourier transform system, while it decreases dramatically as the observation position moves off axis in a Fresnel system. In this paper, we review the speckle correlation function in general linear canonical transform (LCT) systems, clearly demonstrating that speckle properties can be controlled by introducing different optical components, i.e., lenses and sections of free space. Using a series of numerical simulations, we examine how the correlation function changes for some typical LCT systems. The integrating effect of the camera pixel and the impact this has on the measured first-and second-order statistics of the speckle intensities is also examined theoretically. A series of experimental results are then presented to confirm several of these predictions. First, the effect the pixel size has on the measured first-order speckle statistics is demonstrated, and second, the orientation of speckles in a Fourier transform system is measured, showing that the speckles lie parallel to the optical axis. © 2012 Optical Society of America.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863066223

For reasons of mathematical simplicity the longitudinal speckle size is often derived by examining the decorrelation of the speckle field for a single point lying on axis, i.e., x = y = 0, and this size is generally assumed to be representative for other speckles that lie further offaxis. Some recent theoretical results, however, indicate that in fact longitudinal speckle size gets smaller as the observation position moves to off-axis spatial locations. In this paper (Part I), we review the physical argument leading to this conclusion and support this analysis with a series of robust numerical simulations. We discuss, in some detail, computational issues that arise when simulating the propagation of speckle fields numerically, showing that the spectral method is not a suitable propagation algorithm when the autocorrelation of the scattering surface is assumed to be delta correlated. In Part II [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 28, 1904 (2011)] of this paper, experimental results are provided that exhibit the predicted variation of longitudinal speckle size as a function of position in x and y.

Digital holography is the process where the intensity of the superposition of the two waves is recorded using a light sensitive opto-electronic detector array such as a CCD or CMOS camera. From this recorded hologram it is possible to numerically reconstruct the object wavefield. When an optical beam is focused on a pinhole whose diameter is of the order of a few times the wavelength of the illumination beam, a spherically divergent wavefield is emitted. We use the emitted optical beam to illuminate weakly scattering objects resulting in a geometrically magnified diffraction pattern at the camera face. Scattered light from the object is the called the object wavefield, while unscattered light acts as the reference wavefield. The hologram is captured digitally before numerical reconstruction is applied to yield whole field information about the object. It is possible to reconstruct the objects wavefield using this method from coherent laser or incoherent LED illumination. The emitted light from the pinhole acts a pointsource of spatially coherent light enabling holography. This, in combination with the use of multiple wavelength LED's multispectral amplitude images can be reconstructed.

A method involving the recording of very large period gratings, i.e. which diffract in the Raman-Nath regime, has been proposed, the results of which have been interpreted to suggest a diffusion rate of the order of 10 -8cm 2/s. Using a similar acrylamide and polyvinylalcohol based material, the experiment involves monitoring the evolution of the zeroth order diffraction efficiency, the decay of which it is assumed is solely due to diffusion of the monomer.

Unlike off-axis holography, object information is not modulated onto carrier fringes, thus in-line digital holography makes optimum use of the recording device's sampling bandwidth resulting in higher resolution digital holograms. However, reconstructed images are obscured by the linear superposition of the unwanted out of focus twin images. In addition to this, speckle noise degrades overall quality of the reconstructed images. The speckle effect is an optical phenomenon arising when laser sources are used in digital holographic systems. Minimizing the effects due to speckle noise, removal of the twin image and using the full sampling bandwidth of the capture device, aids overall reconstructed image quality. Using interferometric techniques, it is possible to record whole field information about an object. Digital processing of the reconstructed holograms can remove or suppress the twin image while effects from speckle noise can also be reduced numerically.

In-line digital holographic techniques offer full use of the recording device's sampling bandwidth, unlike off-axis holography where object information is not modulated onto carrier fringes. Reconstructed images are obscured by the linear superposition of the unwanted, out of focus, twin images. In addition to this, speckle noise degrades overall quality of the reconstructed images. The speckle effect is a phenomenon of laser sources used in digital holographic systems. Minimizing the effects due to speckle noise, removal of the twin image and using the full sampling bandwidth of the capture device aids overall reconstructed image quality. Such improvements applied to digital holography can benefit applications such as holographic microscopy where the reconstructed images are obscured with twin image information. Overcoming such problems allows greater flexibility in current image processing techniques, which can be applied to segmenting biological cells (e.g. MCF-7 and MDA-MB- 231) to determine their overall cell density and viability.

Ever increasing requirements, driven by application developments, has lead to the rapid development of newer generations of such materials. As the ever increasing number of new materials is developed and used, there is a need to characterize the material behavior pre-and post exposure. In order to produce materials with a desired set of material properties one has to understand the photochemical processes present during recording. Although in most case emphasis is placed on studying the high spatial frequency response and the related limitations of such materials, the low spatial frequency response characteristics can also supply useful information regarding the processes taking place during grating formation. In this paper we present the experimental results obtained following a detailed examination of the low spatial frequency response of a photopolymer material in the case of exposure at different recording intensities. The time dependence of the diffraction efficiency of the grating must be then analyzed using the appropriate diffraction theory of phase gratings.

A deeper understanding of the processes, which occur during holographic grating formation in photopolymers, is necessary in order to develop a fully comprehensive model, which represents their behaviour. One of these processes is photo-initiation, whereby a photon is absorbed by a photosensitiser producing free radicals, which can initiate free radical polymerisation. These free radicals can also participate in polymer chain termination (primary termination) and it is therefore necessary to understand their generation in order to predict the temporally varying kinetic effects present during holographic grating formation. In this paper, a study of the photoinitiation mechanisms of Irgacure 784 dye, in an epoxy resin matrix, is carried out. This is achieved by analysing the temporal evolution of a series of simultaneously captured experimental transmittance curves, captured at different wavelengths, but at the same location, to enable the change in photon absorption during exposure to be estimated.

For the case when a cipher-text pair has been obtained and the correct decryption key is unknown, an iterative attack technique can be employed to ascertain the key. During such an attack the noise in the output field for an attempted decryption can be used as a measure of a possible decryption key's correctness. For relatively small systems, i.e., systems involving fewer than 5 X 5 pixels, the output decryption of every possible key can be examined to evaluate the distribution of the keys in key space in relation to their relative performance when carrying out decryption. However, in order to do this for large systems, checking every single key is currently impractical. One metric used to quantify the correctness of a decryption key is the normalized root mean squared (NRMS) error. The NRMS is a measure of the cumulative intensity difference between the input and decrypted images. We identify a core term in the NRMS, which we refer to as the difference parameter, d. Expressions for the expected value (or mean) and variance of d are derived in terms of the mean and variance of the output field noise, which is shown to be circular Gaussian. These expressions assume a large sample set (number of pixels and keys). We show that as we increase the number of samples used, the decryption error obeys the statistically predicted characteristic values.

The spatial frequency response of an acrylamide/polyvinylalcohol-based photopolymer is then improved through the addition of a chain transfer agent (CTA), sodium formate. Using the NPDD model demonstrates that the CTA has the effect of decreasing the average length of the polyacrylamide (PA) chains formed, thus reducing the nonlocal response parameter, or.

The photopolymer recording material used in this study is an Acrylamide/PVA based material. In this paper, having determined values for some basic properties of the material such as diffusion of Polyacrylamide and diffusion of water, we now look at chemically modifying the material and experimentally determine the impact. An important material characteristic, which determines the performance of any photopolymer medium, is the spatial frequency response of that material. Previously, applying our Non-local Photo-Polymerisation Driven Diffusion Model, (NPDD), we have discussed the effects on material behaviour of the length of the polymer chains and the rates of diffusion within the material. These parameters have been shown to be important in determining the response of the material. If the average length of the Polyacrylamide chains is shortened, an increase in the diffusion coefficient might be observed. Shorter Polyacrylamide chains should then result in an increase in the materials spatial frequency response, and ultimately in an increase in holographic data storage capacity. One possible method of doing this is to modify the chemical composition of the material to control chain length using, for example, chain transfer agents. The rates of diffusion of the material, both before and after modification of the chemical composition, is compared to determine the impact. Shortening the chains should result hi the possibility of creating smaller structures in the photopolymer material.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751437056

This method provides a novel method for the control of the pre-cured lens profile and hence the final solid lens optical properties. This method also allows the fabrication of aspheric lenses using the UV-curable technique with the degree of aspericity controlled in real time by varying the applied electric field.

The free radical chain polymerization process results in polymer being generated nonlocal both in space and time to the point of chain initiation. Temporal nonlocality can be used to describepost exposure dark effects. Nonlinear response and the effects of dye bleaching have been examined. Both primary and bimolecular chain termination mechanisms have been included and examined. Recently 3-D, and inhibition effects have also been included. In this paper we review of our recent work. It is shown that temporal effects become most notable for short exposres and the inclusion of the nonlocal temporal response function is shown to be necessary to accurately describe the process. In particular, brief post exposure self-amplification of the refractive index modulation is noted. This is attributed to continued chain growth for a brief period after exposure. Following this a slight decay in the grating amplitude also occurs. This we believe is due to the continued diffusion of monomer after exposure. Since the sinusoidal recording pattern generates a monomer concentration gradient during the recording process monomer diffusion occurs both during and after exposure. The evolution of the refractive index modulation is determined by the respective refractive index values of the recording material components. From independent measurements it is noted that the refractive index value of the monomer is slightly less than that of the background material. Therefore as monomer diffuses back into the dark regions, a reduction in overall refractive index modulation occurs. Volume changes occurring within the material also affect the nature of grating evolution. To model these effects we employ a free volume concept. Due to the fact that the covalent single carbon bond in the polymer is up to 50% shorter than the van der Waals bond in the liquid monomer state, free volume is created when monomer is converted to polymer. For each bond conversion we assume a hole is generated which then collapses at some characteristic rate constant. The Lorentz-Lorenz relation is used to determine the overall evolution refractive index modulation and the corresponding diffraction efficiency of the resulting grating is calculated using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA). The Lorentz-Lorenz relation is used to determine the overall evolution refractive index modulation and the corresponding diffraction efficiency of the resulting grating is calculated using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA). Inhibition is typically observed at the start of grating growth during which the formation of polymer chains is suppressed. In this paper experiments are reported, carried out with the specific aim of understanding of these processes. The results support our description of the inhibition process in an PVA/Acrylamide based photopolymer and can be used to predict behaviour under certain conditions.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750012011

In this paper the NPDD model is extended to include a nonlocal material temporal response. Previously it was assumed that following a brief transient period, the spatial effect of chain growth was instantaneous. However, where the use of short exposures is necessary, as in optical data storage, temporal effects become more significant. Assuming that the effect of past chain initiations will have less effect on monomer concentration at a later point in time than current initiations, a normalized exponential function is proposed to describe the process. The extended diffusion model is then solved using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain technique to predict the evolution of the monomer and polymer concentrations during and after grating recording. The Lorentz-Lorenz relation is used to determine the corresponding refractive index modulation and The Rigorous Coupled Wave Method applied to determine and/or process diffraction efficiencies. A fitting technique is then used which first solves the diffusion model as described and determines a set of parameters which give best fits to the experimental data. Results show that the inclusion of the nonlocal temporal response is necessary to accurately describe grating evolution for short exposures i.e. continued polymer chain growth for some period after recording resulting in an increase in the refractive index modulation. Monomer diffusion is also shown to influence refractive index modulation post-exposure.

Applications include imaging and display of three-dimensional (3D) objects, and encryption and pattern recognition of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D objects. Often, these optical systems employ discrete spatial light modulators (SLMs) such as liquid-crystal displays. In the 2D case, SLMs can encode the inputs and keys during encryption and decryption. For 3D processing, the SLM can be used as part of an optical reconstruction technique for 3D objects, and can also represent the key during encryption and decryption. However, discrete SLMs can represent only discrete levels of data necessitating a quantisation of continuous valued analog information. To date, many such optical systems have been proposed in the literature, yet there has been relatively little experimental evaluation of the practical performance of discrete SLMs in these systems. In this paper, we characterise conventional phase-modulating liquid-crystal devices and examine their limitations (in terms of phase quantisation, alignment tolerances, and nonlinear response) for the encryption of 2D and 3D data. Finally, we highlight the practical importance of a highly controlled discretisation (optimal quantisation) for compression of digital holograms.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749539141

These models suppose that the photopolymer layer is homogeneous in depth. Using this approximation good results can be obtained if the thickness of photopolymers is less than 200 μm. However, it is well known that Lambert-Beer's law predicts an exponential decay of the light inside the material. In recent years intensive efforts have been made to develop new holographic memories based on photopolymers. For this application the thickness of the layer is increased, usually to more than 500 μm, and Lambert-Beer's law plays a significant role in the recording step. The attenuation of the index profile inside these materials has been measured, showing that it is an important phenomenon. This attenuation limits the maximum effective optical thickness of the grating and shows that the 2-D models can not be applied in these cases. For this reason in this work a 3-dimensional model is presented to analyze the real behaviour of the photopolymers and study the variations in the index profile in depth. In this work we examine the predictions of the model in the case of a general dependence of the polymerisation rate with respect to the intensity pattern, and the effects of varying the exposure intensity are also compared in 3-D cases. Finally, the limitation of the data storage capacity of the materials due to the Lambert-Beer law is evaluated.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749561236

One such application is data storage. Optimising the holographic recording materials is therefore of critical importance in the capacity and clarity of the information stored. Photopolymer materials are practical materials for use as holographic recording media, as they are inexpensive and self-processing. Understanding the photochemical mechanisms present during recording in these materials is crucial in enabling further developments. Obtaining critical material parameters allows improvements of the performance of these materials, such as its spatial frequency response or its environmental stability. This also allows a better understanding of the photochemical processes that occur during the formation of the holographic grating. Our current work, which is presented in this paper deals with two of the processes that occur during holographic grating formation. The first of these is the photochemistry involved in the absorption of the light by the photosensitive dye. We monitor the power of the transmitted beams, which are used for recording the gratings. The second process we concentrate on is the inhibition effect present during grating growth. It has been noted in the literature that there is a slight delay at the start of grating growth. The reason for this delay is due to an inhibition process, which is present to some extent in all photopolymer recordings. The work presented here explains why it occurs. A theoretical model is developed to predict the behaviour of the temporal evolution of the grating. This model has been improved to account for the absorption effects of the material due to the photosensitive dye and the inhibition period, which results in a reduction in the rate of polymerisation.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746848526

Because of their relatively low cost and ease of use, due to their self-processing nature, photopolymers provide many potential advantages as the holographic recording material and data storage medium of choice. Photopolymers show promise, for example, for Write-Once Read-Many (WORM) storage systems. The photopolymer recording medium used in this study is an Acrylamide/Polyvinylalcohol (A/PVA) based dry layer. An important material characteristic, which determines the performance of any photopolymer medium, is the spatial frequency response of that material. Previously, applying our Non-local Photo-Polymerisation Driven Diffusion Model, (NPDD), we have discussed the effects on material behaviour of the length of the polymer chains and the rates of diffusion within the material. These parameters have been shown to be critically important in determining the response of the material. If the average length of the Polyacrylamide (photopolymerised Acrylamide monomer, PA), chains is shortened, an increase in the diffusion coefficient of these molecules might be observed. According to the NPDD shorter PA chains should then result in an increase in the materials spatial frequency response, and ultimately in an increase in holographic data storage capacity. In this paper we report on several experiments carried out (a) to determine the diffusion constant of the PA and (b) to also determine the diffusion constants of both water and Propanol in our material layers.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746720194

Indeed it can be shown that many well know optical transforms such as the Optical Fourier Transform (OFT)2 Optical Fractional Fourier Transform (OFRT)3-5, the effect of a lens or Chirp Modulation Transform (CMT) are all subsets of the more general LCT. Using the ABCD Collins matrix formula it is possible to represent these integral transforms in a simpler form1, which facilitates system analysis and design. Speckle Photography (SP) in combination with an optical LCT can be used to measure surface motion of an optically rough body. It has previously been shown6, 7 that Optical FRT's (OFRT) can be used in speckle based metrology systems to vary the range and sensitivity of a metrology system and also to determine both, the magnitude and direction, of tilting (rotation) and translation motion simultaneously, provided that the motion is captured in two separate OFRT domains. In this paper we extend the OFRT analysis to more general LCT systems and demonstrate how simultaneous tilt and translation measurements can be discerned from the speckle images captured prior to, and after motion. A spherical wavefront can be conveniently described using the Collin's matrix notation. By changing the wavefront of the illuminating light we show that we effectively change the domain of the LCT system without changing the bulk elements in the optical system.

There are many different methods of fabricating these micro-optical elements. One such technique to produce microlenses is the UV-curable resin method. This method involves the application of droplets of UV-curable resin to a substrate, which can then be cured using UV light. The quality of the lenses produced using this method can vary due to a number of experimental difficulties. These include the fact that the UV resin shrinks as it is cured. This shrinkage effect is a difficult problem, as it is a property of the UV material and the substrate. The ability to pre-shape the liquid droplet may enable the manufacturer to compensate for this shrinkage. In this paper we propose a method to generate a controlled perturbation of the liquid profile and hence the optical properties of the final lens. We describe our method of inducing variations in the droplet profile using an applied electric field. This method enables the fabrication of aspheric lenses. The analysis of this fabrication method requires the development of an accurate lens profile measurement system. A number of techniques can be used to examine the resulting lens elements including mechanical techniques such as Dektak profilometry and optical techniques such as interferometric techniques including laser profiler and white light profiler.

The free radical chain polymerization process results in polymer being generated nonlocal both in space and time to the point of chain initiation. A Gaussian spatial material response function and an exponential temporal material response function are used to account for these effects. In this paper we firstly examine the nature of the temporal evolution of grating formation for short recording periods. It is shown that in this case, temporal effects become most notable and the inclusion of the nonlocal temporal response function is shown to be necessary to accurately describe the process. In particular, brief post exposure self-amplification of the refractive index modulation is noted. This is attributed to continued chain growth for a brief period after exposure. Following this a slight decay in the grating amplitude also occurs. This we believe is due to the continued diffusion of monomer after exposure. Since the sinusoidal recording pattern generates a monomer concentration gradient during the recording process monomer diffusion occurs both during and after exposure. The evolution of the refractive index modulation is determined by the respective refractive index values of the recording material components. From independent measurements it is noted that the refractive index value of the monomer is slightly less than that of the background material. Therefore as monomer diffuses back into the dark regions, a reduction in overall refractive index modulation occurs. Volume changes occurring within the material also affect the nature of grating evolution. To model these effects we employ a free volume concept. Due to the fact that the covalent single carbon bond in the polymer is up to 50% shorter than the van der Waals bond in the liquid monomer state, free volume is created when monomer is converted to polymer. For each bond conversion we assume a hole is generated which then collapses at some characteristic rate constant. Incorporating each of these effects into our model, the model is then solved using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain method (FDTD). The Lorentz-Lorenz relation is used to determine the overall evolution refractive index modulation and the corresponding diffraction efficiency of the resulting grating is calculated using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA). Fits are then carried out to experimental data for 1 second exposures. Good quality fits are achieved and material parameters extracted. Monomer diffusion rates are determined to be of the order of D ∼ 10-10 cm 2/s and the time constant of the nonlocal material temporal response function being of the order of τn ∼ 10-2s. Material shrinkage occurring over these recording periods is also determined.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746688604

The effect of the glass substrate is therefore sufficiently significant, and care must be taken in order to choose the appropriate thickness of the glass if maximum diffraction efficiency is to be achieved.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744975251

A nonlocal diffusion model is used to predict theoretically the grating evolution. The model has been developed to account for both nonlocal spatial and temporal effects in the medium, which can be attributed to polymer chain growth. Previously it was assumed that the temporal effect of chain growth could be neglected. However, temporal effects due to chain growth and monomer diffusion are shown to be significant, particularly over short recording periods where dark field amplification is observed. The diffusion model is solved using a finite-difference technique to predict the evolution of the monomer and polymer concentrations throughout grating recording. Using independently measured refractive index values for each component of the recording medium, the Lorentz-Lorenz relation is used to determine the corresponding refractive index modulation. The corresponding diffraction efficiency is then determined using rigorous coupled wave analysis. The diffraction efficiency curves are presented for gratings recorded using short exposure times, monitored in real time, both during and after recording. The effect of volume shrinkage of polymer on grating evolution is also examined. Both the nonlocal temporal response of the material and monomer diffusion are shown to influence refractive index modulation postexposure. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745230443

In this paper we discuss the design and analysis of systems used in the capture, encryption/decryption and display of 2-D (image) data and present our recent experimental and theoretical results.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-30644460550

Materials such as Acrylamide-based photopolymers are good holographic recording materials, as they are inexpensive and self-processing. The diffusion rate of monomer and the molecular weight of polymerised monomer determine many material characteristics. The length (size) of the polymer chains has a direct effect on the diffusion rate of the polymer and shortening the chain length leads to an increase in the diffusion rate. Shorter chains also decrease the non-local material response parameter and, in consequence, lead to an increase in the spatial frequency response of the material. Thus it is expected that by controlling the polymer chain length (molecular weight) one might control the material spatial frequency response. In this paper we look at the effect of varying the quantity of crosslinking agents on the material and its impact on the rate of diffusion. We then look at determining the rate of diffusion of water within the material to provide a lower limit to the maximum rate of monomer diffusion.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-31744449469

One of the main assumptions made in [1] is that a long material relaxation time can be permitted between exposures. Another was that no phase shifts of the exposing pattern took place between exposures. In this paper we discuss these assumption and develop an intermediate first-order model. In a second paper [2], based on the results presented in [1] we have shown that our optimized predictions are in agreement with the scaling law of holographic diffraction. Thus the law is shown to hold for photopolymer recording media governed by the predictions of the NPDD. Based on our analysis: (i) A media inverse scaling law is proposed; (ii) Γ is for the first time related to photopolymer material parameters and the hologram geometry and replay conditions; and (iii) The form and validity of the diffraction efficiency inverse square scaling law for higher diffraction efficiency gratings is commented upon.

One promising type of material is Acrylamide-based photopolymer recording materials. The material can be made self-processing and can be sensitised to different recording wavelengths using different photosensitive dyes. The self-processing capability of this material simplifies the recording and testing processes and enables holographic interferometry to be carried out without the need for complex realignment procedures. Although this material has a lot of advantages over others it has significant disadvantages such as its spatial frequency response range (500-2500 lines/mm). Therefore, it is of ever-increasing importance to resolve uncertainties regarding optical and material properties, i.e. the refractive index and the diffusion constants. Using experimental diffraction efficiency measurements, a value for the refractive index modulation can be obtained. Then carrying out analysis using the Polymerisation Driven Diffusion model (PDD) values for the diffusion coefficients of various materials in the grating layer can be found. Applying the Lorentz-Lorenz relation, refractive index variations within the material can be more fully understood.

Photopolymer materials provide potentially good materials for holographic recording, as they are inexpensive and self-processing. Many experiments have been reported in the literature that describe the diffraction efficiency and angular selectivity of such materials. The majority of these reports discuss the performance of the holographic optical element after the recording stage. It has been observed, however, that sometimes, during exposure, the transmitted recording beam intensities vary with time. A simple phenomenological model is proposed to explain the beam modulation, which incorporates the growth of the phase grating, time-varying absorption effects, the mechanical motion of the plate, the growth of a lossy absorption grating during the recording process, and the effects of nonideal beam ratios. © 2005 Optical Society of America.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-25444456967

One of the basic requirements for this application is that the recording material thickness must be 500 μm or thicker. In recent years many 2-dimensional models have been proposed for the analysis of photopolymers. Good agreement between theoretical simulations and experimental results has been obtained for layers thinner than 200 μm. The attenuation of the light inside the material by Beer's law results in an attenuation of the index profile inside the material and in some cases the effective optical thickness of the material is lower than the physical thickness. This is an important and fundamental limitation in achieving high capacity holographic memories using photopolymers and cannot be analyzed using 2-D diffusion models. In this paper a model is proposed to describe the behavior of the photopolymers in 3-D.

Random phase keys (RPK) or random shifting stages are applied after transformation and the process is repeated for deeper encryption. Each such stage may change the spatial extent of the complex distribution and may also change the spatial frequency bandwidth of the signal. Therefore, the space bandwidth product (SBP), which is equal to the number of discrete samples that are required to fully represent the encrypted signal (and are required to recover the original), will also change. In general the encrypted field is complex and recording must be carried out using a holographic material or using digital holographic methods. We show how the matrices associated with the effect of a LCT on the Wigner distribution function (WDF) provide us with an efficient method for finding the position, spatial extent, spatial frequency extent and SBP of the encrypted signal. Applying the technique, we review a number of methods proposed in the literature for encryption using optical systems based on the FT, FRT, FST and LCT.

When the effective thickness is known, then the real storage capacity of the material can be obtained. © 2005 Optical Society of America.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17444370192

In most cases this involves the use of optical transforms based on quadratic phase systems (to implement the optical Fourier Transform (FT), the optical fractional Fourier Transform (FRT), the Fresnel transform (FST) and the most general Linear Canonical Transform (LCT). Random phase screens or random shifting.stages are applied after optically transforming to a new domain. The process may be repeated for deeper encryption. Each stage of the encryption process may change the position and spatial extension of the complex distribution on the plane normal to the propagation axis. Each stage may also change the frequency distribution of the signal. Therefore, the space bandwidth product (SBP), which is equal to the number of discrete samples that are required to fully represent our signal, will also change. In general the encrypted image is complex and recording must be carried out using a holographic material or using digital holographic methods. In each case it is desirable to know the spatial extension of the signal to be recorded, its position, and its spatial frequency extension. In this way we can determine which holographic materials will meet the criteria or which cameras will have a suitable number of pixels, greater than or equal to the space bandwidth product, if digital holography is used. We show how the matrices associated with the effect of a LCT on the Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) provide us with an efficient method for finding the position, spatial extent, spatial frequency extent and space bandwidth product of the encrypted signal. We review a number of methods, which have recently been proposed in the literature for the encryption of two-dimensional information using optical systems based on the FT, FRT, FST and LCT. We apply the new matrix technique to some of them.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-14944346726

The development of these micro-optical devices has been carried out by many different researchers working in a variety of areas. This has lead to a large number of different fabrication techniques. We examine a novel fabrication technique that may allow the development of large arrays of elements quickly and cheaply. It is known that the exposure of dye sensitised Acrylamide layers to light can lead to material refractive index and volume changes. It is therefore proposed that a patterned exposure can be used to form a mixture of volume and surface relief patterning, enabling the production of optical elements. The examination of this fabrication technique, in particular the study of the processes that result in this volume change, may also lead to improvements in the photopolymer material so as to control shrinkage of these materials. The development of low shrinkage holographic recording materials is an active area in holography as most current photopolymer materials exhibit some volume change during the recording process. This has implications for the fidelity of the replayed image. This is of crucial importance in areas such as data storage systems. The further study of this process also has implications for the wider holographic research community. It is important to understand the surface relief profile of the holographic element prior to extracting grating parameters as surface relief effects may influence the experimental data. In this paper we describe initial experimental attempts to produce micro-optical elements for use in the visible spectrum using patterned exposure of an Acrylamide based photopolymer material.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-13444252664

Characteristics such as good light sensitivity, large dynamic range, good optical properties and relatively low cost make photopolymers one of the most promising materials for write-one, read-many (WORM) holographic data storage applications. Thus, it is interesting to understand the mechanisms that control the way information is stored in photopolymer materials. Different authors have demonstrated that two processes play the main role in hologram formation: monomer polymerization and monomer diffusion. A number of models based on these two processes have been proposed and their prediction capability has been validated. In this work we extend the capabilities of the existent models by introducing another important characteristic: the attenuation of light through the depth of the material which happens in the recording process. In order to check the validity of the theoretical model that we propose, volume phase transmission gratings are recorded in a PVA/Acrylamide photopolymer with different spatial frequencies. Using the Rigorous Coupled Wave Theory (RCWT) we show that we can obtain information about the higher harmonics in the recorded refractive index modulation.

The existence of different models that predict the mechanism of hologram formation inside photopolymers, has increased the possibilities of an accurate understanding of the processes involved inside photopolymers during the exposure process. A great deal of experimental research has been done, in order to test the theoretical assumptions. Nonetheless, there is little quantitative data available about higher harmonics components of the refractive index. This is due to the fact that, apart from a few works, Kogelnik's coupled wave theory has been used to fit the temporal evolution of the diffraction efficiency of the first order. The use of this theory does not allow us to obtain information about higher orders and consequently about the higher harmonics in the refractive index. In this paper we apply an algorithm based in the rigorous coupled wave theory to reproduce the angular response curves of the different orders that propagate inside the hologram. This study will be done for attenuated in depth grating profiles. Experimental data for the angular responses of the first and second orders, centered at first and second on Bragg angular replay conditions, will be examined. The experimental data provided will demonstrate that attenuation occurs inside the hologram during the recording step, most probably because of Beer's Law.

One technique that has been used to produce arrays is the reflow of photoresist method first suggested by Popovic et al. in 1988. This technique utilises mature fabrication patterning technology, i.e. photolithography, however when lenses are produced they are often found to have large deviations from the spherical case. This limits the range of f-numbers, f/#, that can be produced. There are a number of polynomial models that have been presented in the literature that are used to model the resulting lens profiles, however these models are not based on the physical nature of the fabrication technique and hence provide no information about the processes involved. One model that attempts to model the profile from a physical basis has been reported in the literature, the Curvature Correction Model, (CCM), by Abe and Sheridan in 1999.

They have many advantages, such as ease of preparation, and are capable of efficiencies of up to 100%. A disadvantage of these materials is their inability to record high spatial frequency gratings when compared to other materials such as dichromated gelatin and silver halide photographic emulsion. Until recently, the drop off at high spatial frequencies of the material response was not predicted by any of the diffusion based models available. It has recently been proposed that this effect is due to polymer chains growing away from their initiation point and causing a smeared profile to be recorded. This is termed a non-local material response. Simple analytic expressions have been derived using this model and fits to experimental data have allowed values to be estimated for material parameters such as the diffusion coefficient of monomer, the ratio of polymerisation rate to diffusion rate and the distance that the polymer chains spread during holographic recording. The model predicts that the spatial frequency response might be improved by decreasing the mean polymer chain lengths and/or by increasing the mobility of the molecules used in the material. The experimental work carried out to investigate these predictions is reported here. This work involved (a) the changing of the molecular weights of chemical components within the material (dyes and binders) and (b) the addition of a chemical retarder in order to shorten the polymer chains, thereby decreasing the extent of the nonlocal effect. Although no significant improvement in spatial frequency response was observed the model appears to offer an improved understanding of the operation of the material.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035211387

The recording material has a resolution of 3000 lines/mm and there is no distortion of slanted gratings. This allows high inter-beam angles in transmission recording and makes the material particularly suitable for the holographic recording of diffractive optical elements. The implications of the resolution limit and other material properties for DOE fabrication are discussed in some detail and results for the recording of on-and off-axis focusing and beam splitting diffractive optical elements are presented.

As well as making ordinary transmission holography and DOE recording more convenient, this makes the material particularly useful for both live fringe and double exposure holographic interferometry. Live fringes can be viewed as soon as any stress is applied to the object.

The boundary diffraction method is used for analysis of thick transmission geometry gratings in a unified way that deals with both the slanted and the unslanted cases. During the analysis, evidence emerges for the superiority of the first-order two-wave beta-value method over the Kogelnik k-vector closure method.

The first of these elements is a metal coated wet-chemically etched v-groove grating in silicon with a period of 20 μm for a wavelength of 10.6 μm.

These elements can reorder and change the spacing of a set of input channels at an output plane. Here an implementation of such an element that uses holographic gratings is presented and theoretically analysed. Each individual grating is recorded in a rotated position with respect to the others. In this way arbitrary 2D interconnections are achieved at the cost of growing design complexity. The complexity of the exposure procedure results from the wish for high diffraction efficiency at reconstruction with light of mixed polarization. The inclusion of the Fresnel reflection coefficients adds further to the difficulty of the analysis. Experimental and theoretical results are compared and found to be broadly in agreement. This information is then used to implement two practical components. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745267828

Optical systems consisting of several elements can be built by recording planar HOEs side by side onto a common planar substrate - a light guiding plate. By folding the light path, i.e., using multiple reflections within this plate, the light is guided from one HOE to the other. This concept is investigated for two applications: (1) An optoelectronic board to board interconnection based on holographic coupling elements on a light guiding plate: Diode lasers and pin diodes were used as optoelectronic transmitters at a data rate of 500 MBits/s. The coupling elements were volume gratings, recorded in dichromated gelatine (DCG) and coated onto the surface of the light guiding plate. Inside the plate the light was guided by total internal reflection. An overall loss of this transmission system of -2.6 dB over a distance of 11 cm was observed. (2) A miniaturized sensor head for the optical measurement of velocities of fluids based on laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV): HOEs mounted onto a glass substrate are used for beamsplitting and deflection.
